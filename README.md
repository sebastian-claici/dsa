Data Structures and Algorithms
==============================
#### A (hopefully) comprehensive list of data structures and algorithms useful in programming contests. ####

Introduction
------------

The aim of this repository is to provide a central hub with robust implementations of the data structures and algorithms one might encounter during algorithmics programming contests.

Most of the inspiration comes from [here](http://www.infoarena.ro/arhiva-educationala). Another website with a similar goal is [here](http://e-maxx.ru/algo/).
